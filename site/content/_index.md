    heading: About Me
    text: | 
        I am a CIHR Health Systems Impact Postdoctoral Fellow at the Offord Centre for Child Studies at McMaster University and the Lab for Youth Mental Health at Harvard University. Through the Health Systems Fellowship, I am also embedded within School Mental Health Ontario. 
        
        My program of research applies rigorous methodological and analytic methods to advance the understanding of how youths’ close, interpersonal relationships, mainly friendship and dating relationships, shape their mental health. A key focus of this work is examining the specific experiences in close relationships that are associated with better or worse adjustment. 
      
        Further, I aim to advance the measurement of these relationship experiences to better inform clinical assessment and intervention. The ultimate goal of my work is to enrich the sound measurement needed to inform and evaluate targeted intervention initiatives towards ensuring youth are able to thrive in their interpersonal relationships and beyond.
intro:
    heading: "Research"
    text: |
        My research focuses on applying rigorous methodological and analytic methods, such as multilevel meta-analyses and longitudinal methods, to advance the understanding of how youths’ close, interpersonal relationships shape their mental health. I am particularly interested in the relationships that youth hold that are voluntary (unlike relationships with family), and that are key for shaping adjustment in adolescence: friendship and dating relationships. 
      
        Specifically, my work aims to answer: How do youths’ interpersonal relationships shape their mental health? What specific experiences in young people’s close relationships are associated with better or worse adjustment, and how can we improve our measurement of these experiences?
